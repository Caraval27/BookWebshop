# Book Webshop

This lab assignment involved developing a simple webshop application as part of the Distributed Information Systems course, taken during my final year of my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. The project was implemented using Java, HTML, and CSS, and it utilized the following technologies:

- Tomcat Server: For deploying and running the application.
- JSP Pages: For dynamic web content generation.
- MySQL: For managing the backend database.

The project focused on applying distributed systems concepts to create a functional, interactive web application.

### The architechtural structure of the application, and relations/connection between the layers
